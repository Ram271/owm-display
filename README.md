Weather Display
===============

This page is a small, HTML- and JS-only, website to show basic weather information
for a sailing spot in southern germany.

When using this site for any other spot, please edit the settings `position` and
`apikey` in the file `js/loader.js`:

    position = "49.106389,10.987222";
    apikey = "your-api-key";

Then open the file in your browser.
